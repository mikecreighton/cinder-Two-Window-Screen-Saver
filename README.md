cinder-Two-Window-Screen-Saver
==============================

This example project demonstrates how to handle showing a Cinder-based screen saver only in the primary display when a computer is connected to two displays. This is a Windows-only example and uses a second native window to black out the secondary monitor.

This was built against Cinder 0.8.4 using Visual C++ 2010 Express.

The project should be put in its own directory within the cinder\samples directory in order to compile correctly.
